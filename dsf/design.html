            <h4 class='text-center'><u>Inspiration</u></h4>
            <p>After reading <a href='http://learnpythonthehardway.org/'>Learn Python the Hard Way</a>,
            I figured it was time to get my feet wet and build a web app. A friend recommended Django for its ease of use and popularity. I dove
            into the documentation and cobbled together a webforum that was an outright mess. Not understanding
            85% of what I was doing, I charged ahead until I completed it. The code was confusing, I completely
             violated the DRY principle and had no concept of basic unit testing. A few months later, after
            building another <a href='https://github.com/hellojerry/pizzatime'>app</a> that was more complex
            and a tiny bit better, I figured it was time to improve my development practices.
            I kept on running into a problem where altering one function or class would break something elsewhere.
            I spent a lot of time digging around, finding errors, making spot fixes, and then coming
            back to the same problem two days later. I asked another friend how I should fix this, and
            he told me to start testing my code.</p>
            <p>After finishing the ecommerce app, I read about unit testing, did a few tutorials, and figured that
             I'd redo my first project - the webforum - into something robust,
             that had a clean user interface and didn't break. </p>
            <p>I had picked up a bit of jQuery and figured that instead of making a site based around javascript tricks,
             I'd use javascript to enhance the user experience a little bit, but keep the site primarily static.</p>

            <div class='col-sm-12'>
            <p>This project had fairly simple UI requirements - it needed to be a basic webforum, with an index
             of user profiles. Nothing too crazy - message boards typically are light on AJAX and Javascript due
            to their user requirements. Given that I was only planning on simple helper interactions, and a small
            amount of AJAX GET requests, jQuery fit the bill. I used Twitter Bootstrap as a CSS framework - it's
            fairly intuitive and easy to customize. </p>

            <p>As I was building a static site to return html pages, plain Django was all I needed. My focus
            on this project was primarily building something with properly tested code. There are still some
            untested components - one app, the direct messages app, had nearly trivial CRUD operations, and
            testing didn't seem necessary.</p>
            <p>For hosting, I chose a simple heroku host with AWS S3 storage. Heroku is easy to use, and
            for my skill level at the time it was about all I could handle. If the app had more complex
            requirements than a simple CRUD interface, I'd likely have gone with an AWS EC2 instance.</p>

            <p><b>Good: </b>The tests. The tests were a gigantic timesaver - they prevented regression
            when I added new features and functionalities. It's nice to feel comfortable with your code.</p>
            <p><b>Changes to make: </b>The site, in its current stack, isn't built to scale well. I built
            some methods for the User and Forum models that were analytical in nature - things like "favorite
            thread" or "most popular thread in forum." Every time a user accessed a page that displayed that data,
            the method was run again. For a small amount of users, that's not a big deal. If I had reddit's userbase,
            things might start to run slowly. I could optimize these functions in a few ways - I could run them with
            Cython, I could write raw SQL queries instead of using the ORM - but they'd still be running every time.
            It might be better to offload some of these potentially time consuming functions to something like Celery, periodically
            run them with a broker, and store them as fields in their respective database records. A slimmer solution
             than Celery would be to run cron jobs periodically when request volume is low. After all, it is not critically important
            that a user gets perfectly up-to-date information on who talks the most or what topic is the most popular.</p>
            <p><b>Lessons Learned: </b>
                <ol>
                    <li>Testing is critical! It makes life easier! Do it!</li>
                    <li>The importance of version control. It makes life easier too! Especially when
                    you need a deployment version of an app and a display version of an app.</li>
                    <li>The importance of security. I didn't touch on this earlier, but at one point
                    I published an AWS key onto github. Guess who got a phone call at 2 am telling him
                    he had 200 instances running in Eastern Europe! Guess who uses environment variables now!</li>
