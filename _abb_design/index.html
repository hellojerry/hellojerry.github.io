            <h4 class='text-center'><u>Inspiration</u></h4>
            <p>Back in college I took a Philosophy 101 course to fulfill a requirement, thinking that it
            would be useless. It wasn't at all! One of the assigned materials was a piece called <i>Nicomachean Ethics</i>
            by Aristotle. Aristotle has a way of repeating himself, so I'll keep the description as brief as possible.
            <i>Nicomachean Ethics</i> was intended as life advice for Aristotle's son, Nichomachus. It advances a very
            simple thesis for how to be successful (or achieve <i>Eudaimonia</i>) in life: get into the habit of
            doing the right thing. This ranges from being moral in our sense, to simply sticking to good habits like
            eating properly and exercising regularly.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, it can be hard to stick to habits, and it's even harder to get into habits. I've found
            it takes three weeks or so before a behavior becomes a habit. Accountabillibuddy is designed to help with that.
            For me, it's about getting into a workout routine.</p>
            <p>I, like many people, have a habit of procrastinating. Something like exercise isn't required to pay the
            bills, and so it falls by the wayside more easily, than, say, showing up to work. One way to get out of
            procrastinating is to disincentivize it - make something bad happen to you if you procrastinate.</p>
            <p>For me, the most annoying things in life are robotic phone calls and telemarketers. They drive me up the wall.
            Why not make a robot call me when I miss my workout? I'd do anything to avoid that!</p>

            <h4 class='text-center'><u>User Interface</u></h4>
            <p>After finishing my first two projects, the <a href='https://github.com/hellojerry/django-simple-forum'>message board</a> and the <a href='https://github.com/hellojerry/pizzatime'>ecommerce app</a>,
            I felt dissatisfied with a simple jQuery/HTML/CSS setup. For a message board, you can get away with being light
            on the AJAX and animations - after all, people use message boards for the text in them, not their ease of use.
            The ecommerce app was a different story. I decided not to deploy it after spending a few months of work on it,
            because I hadn't come close to what I was looking for - a seamless, fast-moving interface that grabbed
            information in real-time. JQuery can be bent toward that end, but it doesn't necessarily encourage good development practices.
            I certainly got away with a lot of messy stuff in my ecommerce app. I wanted a site that had no page refreshes. </p>
            <p>After speaking to a friend about cool interface systems, I found AngularJS. It's very powerful, and is packed with useful
            tools for handling animations and instant AJAX processing. I'd heard about the Django REST framework via hackernews,
            and building a RESTful API seemed like a good way to learn more about web development in general. Why not put the two together?</p>
            <p>In retrospect, AngularJS was a great choice. It's not just the elimination of page refreshes - it's the little things
            that users dont notice at first. Things like the built in form validation, and the ability to make custom elements with directives
            to define behavior. With a few lines of code in a directive, for example, <a href='https://github.com/hellojerry/buddy/blob/master/static/app/js/static/directives/numberonly.directive.js'>
            I can prevent users from entering anything except numbers into a form.</a>
            <p>Angular can be frustrating - the error handling is cryptic most days. That being said, it's a great tool.</p>

            <h4 class='text-center'><u>Architecture</u></h4>
            <p><b>Requirements:</b>This project had two unique requirements for me - it needed to serve an API, and it needed
            to handle multiple processes that weren't directly related to handling requests (timed jobs, in particular). For the server
            framework, knowing python as a server side language, my options were what I knew: Django, and to a lesser extent,
            Flask. It wasn't a hard decision between the two: Django's "batteries-included" philosophy meant that I had
            a lot of security issues, like CSRF validation, handled at the outset without a need to pick and choose external modules.
            Building an API, using a front-end framework, and handling backend processes were enough to learn. The Django REST framework
            in particular simplifies building JSON APIs and has excellent documentation. For more fine-grained control, I'd have gone with Flask.</p>
            <p><b>Asynchronous Processes:</b>This project's bedrock is timed jobs. In order to keep track of all users' plans and "enforce" them,
            the server needs timed processes. If I allow users to schedule tasks in 30 minute increments, I'll need a cron job to run every 30 minutes
            to make the API call. If this were an irregular task, like a daily database backup, a management command would make more sense,
            and would require less setup. The API calls for Twilio are not particularly time-intensive for a small userbase - my experience has been that they take
            one second or so to handle, but spread across, say, even 500 users it could be a little intense. Combine that with having to handle regular
            request and response handling, and you have a scaling problem. This is where <a href='https://celery.readthedocs.org/en/latest/'>Celery</a> and Redis came into play. Celery
            lets you accomplish asynchronous tasks - it takes the responsibility away from the server itself to handle timed jobs and other tasks
            that don't involve request processing.</p><p> With Celery, I was able to set up task checking at regular intervals, and handle very slow API calls.
            For example, Django's built in mail handler allows easy access to the Gmail API. I use a gmail account to handle confirmation emails, as well as reminder emails.
            From my computer, it can take up to 3-5 seconds to send a canned email through the API. If I processed that while handling a request,
            a user with no latency could have to wait 3-5 seconds for their request to get handled. That's unacceptable! With Celery, the data is passed to Redis, and then
            executed separately from the rest of the request - the user doesn't need to wait any longer. </p>
            <p>A note on using Redis: Celery has excellent support for two brokers: RabbitMQ and Redis. I chose Redis because it is
            lightweight, easy to install, and processes requests faster than RabbitMQ. However, it can lose information about tasks and isn't
            nearly as reliable as RabbitMQ. In this case, the broker is not holding any sensitive data - I'm not dealing with financial transactions.
            If the data was critical to the execution of the app, or my business, I'd likely go with RabbitMQ.</p>

            <h4 class='text-center'><u>Hosting and Servers</u></h4>
            <p><b>Requirements: </b>For many portfolio projects, like my <a href='https://djangoforums.herokuapp.com/'>message board</a>, hosting
            on Heroku is simple and easy - it handles a lot of server configuration automatically.
            I wanted a bit more control over the server side processes, and wanted to
            learn more about configuring things from (mostly) scratch. Amazon Web Services still handles a lot of the work,
            but it requires more hands-on configuration at the command line. I decided upon an EC2 Micro instance, using
            PostgreSQL as a database via their RDS service and serving Redis from their Elasticache service.</p>
            <p><i>PostgreSQL:</i> The choice of database wasn't particularly critical on this project. I chose postgres
            because I am familiar with it, and because django provides unique <a href='https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/contrib/postgres/'>features for Postgres.</a>
            As of yet I haven't needed to use said features, but it never hurts to have extra tools available.</p>
            <p><i>NGINX and Gunicorn:</i> As a relative newbie to server administration, I chose the options with the most
             available resources for an inexperienced user. NGINX was quite easy to use - for my purposes it only required
            writing a few lines in a couple of files inside the /etc/nginx/ directory.</p>
            <p><i>Ubuntu: </i>AWS has a free tier of service in Ubuntu, and Ubuntu is incredibly simple and easy to use. Seeing
            as how I do all of my development in Ubuntu, it seemed like a natural choice.</p>
